Every stylesheet now starts by restating the cascade-layer order (`@layer reset, tokens, vendor, base, components, utilities;`). Layers rank by first appearance, and a bundler decides which file loads first: when a component stylesheet was linked before the reset, `components` became the weakest layer and the reset won, so a primary Button painted as bare text. That is what the deployed Storybook was doing. Importing `@pearpages/pulp-css` first is still the recommended setup, but correct rendering no longer depends on it.
